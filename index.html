            <p>While Captain America's superhuman abilities are far less than most of the
                 more powerful members of the Avengers, it is ridiculous to consider him 
                 to be little more than just a man in combat.  The battle goes to the man 
                 with the greater will and more often than not, Captain America is that man.</p>
